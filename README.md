1. Create a new `.mdx` file under the `content` folder, or edit an existing one.
2. If you added a new `.mdx` file, go to `utils/fs.tsx` and update the `FILENAMES` variable with the proper file order.
3. Build the new pages with `npm run build`
4. Do the usual Github stuff:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin main
```
